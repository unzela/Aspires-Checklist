        <p>Anecdotally, coffee chats have been the most powerful networking tool for me. Remember, most people were once in our shoes and get satisfaction out of helping others. And my experience would suggest that more often than not, people are willing to spend time to help others.
          Life can be so much easier when we chat with the right people at the right time.
